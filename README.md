# chip-8-interpreter
Attempting to make a CHIP-8 Interpretor in Python

Usage:
python main.py "ROM location" "log if you want to see the log otherwise leave it blank"

I have tried it with some roms like Pong and Space Invaders. Some ROMS bug out which I need to fix later on but for now it runs what I wanted it to run so I see this as an absolute win.
